# odin-admin-dashboard
A full dashboard design. 

New cards can be added or deleted - storage is local. 

A functional search bar is at the top that allows card filtering. 

Cards currently have two icons, designed to showcase my projects to anyone interested. The icons link to their respective live pages and github repos. 

Dashboard links on the left can be used to further expand site. 

Current projects and what's next panes provide snippet into what I am currently working on, now and in the future.
